# To-Do-List
In this project, I developed a To-Do List App/Website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed or incomplete, and remove them as needed. To add a new task, users can simply enter it into the input box and click the "Add" button. Clicking on a task name toggles its status between completed and incomplete. A close icon is provided to delete specific tasks from the list.

I utilized Local Storage in JavaScript to save the task list in the user's web browser, ensuring that the list remains available even after the browser is closed and reopened.
